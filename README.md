# university + latex 
This repo servers two purposes

1. To hold all my university notes
2. Holds my latex master and preamble templates for both my and others to benifit from

## How to replicate my env
I use vim + latex for my note taking. Recommend getting comfortable with both vim and latex before trying to take notes using either.
Following links should suffice in providing a sufficient background:

**vim:** https://vimschool.netlify.app/introduction/vimtutor/

**latex:** https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes

> There many other fantastics resources online these are just ones I choose. Also if you have vim already installed typing ```vimtutor``` into your terminal will bring up probably one of the best vim tutorials as well

\

The following is for arch and arch based distros since that is what i am using but you can replicate everything simply using commands for your 

install vim

```
